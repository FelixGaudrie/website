## Expressive head


Reachy’s head may be small, it’s packed with very useful stuff:

Two <b> wide angle cameras </b> with different fields of view to allow Reachy to do facial and object detection.

A <b> pair of antennae </b> which can move and tilt via motors, to make Reachy look even more emotionally expressive.

In-house developed specialized <b> Orbita neck joint </b> that allows the head to swivel, pan and tilt in a human manner.
