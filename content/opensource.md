title: "Open source at heart"
description: "More than just a licence, open source is a collaborative model which is fundamental to the way humans have designed software and hardware infrastructure, and it has been proven a viable approach many times over.


At Pollen Robotics, we aim at fostering knowledge-sharing in the community to help the AI revolution happen. So we believe that instead of attempting to monopolise some particular problem, we have to collaborate with our customers and partners on solutions that will benefit everyone."
